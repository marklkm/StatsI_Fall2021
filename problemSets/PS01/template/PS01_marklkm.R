# Because the sample or n < 30 a t-distribution can be used as opposed to a normal distribution
#  t-distribution is a type of probability distribution. used where the sample size is small.

# The sample size is 25
y <- c(105, 69, 86, 100, 82, 111, 104, 110, 87, 108, 87, 90, 94, 113, 112, 98, 80, 97, 95, 111, 114, 89, 95, 126, 98)

n <- length(y) 
# sample mean
mean(y)
# standard deviation
sd(y)
(sd(y)/sqrt(n))
# CI of 90%
# From tables look for Degree of Freedom or DF of 24 and alpha level of 0.05
# this gives 1.71 or a t-score of 1.71
# 1. 25 - 1 = 24
# 2. 1 - .90 = .05 or the alpha level
# use alpha level of 0.05

upper_lvl <- mean(y) + c90*(sd(y)/sqrt(n))
# get the s or standard deviation of y which is 13.09287
#sd(y)
# Using a 90% confidence level and need to find the confidence interval
# Confidence Level or CI is the margin of error and written as Â±
# CI is to do with how reliable the estimation is
# 1.71 * 13.09287 / square root of 25 = 4.4778
# 98.44 - 4.778 = 93.96 is the lower level
# 98.44 + 4.778 = 102.92 is the upper level
